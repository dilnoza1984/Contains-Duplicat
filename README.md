Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
Extra: Provide a solution with the optimal time complexity. (O(n)) (Do it with a single pass).

 Examples:
  [1,2,3,1] -> true
  [1,2,3,4] -> false
  [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2] -> true
